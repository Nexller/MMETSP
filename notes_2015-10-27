literate resting pipeline:
-fork khmer protocols repository
-edit commands, replace filenames
-create a staging area 
-for each assembly do: 
----create symbolic links in /mnt/mmetsp/staging
----do assembly
----copy to where the data came from
----delete staging area for next round
longterm storage:
-quality-trimmed reads
-assemblies
EBS volume, snapshot of each, to run faster, subset and run in parallel on different instances
end product is one snapshot to share
