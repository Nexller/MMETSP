# MMETSP
This is a repository with info and scripts for how to use data from the Marine Microbial Eukaryotic Transcriptome Sequencing Project (MMETSP), a multi-investigator, multi-institutional public-private initiative. MMETSP is a unique “purpose-built” reference database of standardized transcriptomes from 678 cultured samples of 306 pelagic and endosymbiotic marine eukaryotic species representing more than 40 phyla (Keeling et al. 2014). In their concluding statement, Keeling et al. (2014) point out that establishing this transcriptome sequence database was just the beginning, facilitating possible creative analyses in fields of ecology, physiology, and evolution.
