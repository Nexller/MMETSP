# MMETSP
This is a work-in-progress repository with info and scripts for how to use the large-scale data set from the Marine Microbial Eukaryotic Transcriptome Sequencing Project (MMETSP). MMETSP is a unique set of standardized transcriptomes from 678 cultured samples of 306 pelagic and endosymbiotic marine eukaryotic species representing more than 40 phyla (Keeling et al. 2014).
